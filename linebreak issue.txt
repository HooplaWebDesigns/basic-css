There are several ways to do it. I use <p>&nbsp;</p> 

The standard way in HTML did not work in some versions of the TinyMCE editor. That was why I started using the longer form.


@cindyp - for a single paragraph, how about ...
<p style="padding: 7px;">

Change your CSS - will cause increased space for all paragraphs.
p 	{
	padding: 7px;
	}
I searched everywhere looking for this and finally found it! 




p 	{
	padding: 7px;
